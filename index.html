<h2 style= font-family:Papyrus> Main Characters</h2>
    </body>
<h1> Frisk (The Fallen Child)</h1>
<img src="FSprite.jpeg"> 
    <h3 style= "font-family:Futura"> Frisk is the main character of the game. You play as her/him throughout the magnificent journey that is Undertale. Frisk's sex is highly debated, despite Frisk's sex can be decided through naming them. The name "Frisk" is revealed at the end of the True Pacifist Route, where you don't kill anybody and you spare Flowey, and obeys when he tells you to go see Alphys, saying you could have been better friends. Asriel states that you are not what you call yourself (assuming that you named them.. hm... Billy?). He also states that the real Billy died long ago. And Asriel asks you what your REAL name is. This is where Frisk says "Frisk". </h3>
    <h1>Toriel Dreemurr</h1>
  <img src="Tsprite.jpg">
    <h3 style="font-family:Futura"> Toriel Dreemurr is a wonderful person. She is the queen of the underground and Asgore's ex-wife. After the death of Chara and Asriel, Toriel was disgusted by Asgore's actions of revenge against humanity. Doing so, she ran away from him. She fled to the Ruins, and she now lives out her days there. She is always longing for another human to fall down Mt Ebott again, so she could live with the human, as ever since she ledt Asgore, she has been all alone. Toriel seems to have a strange obsession to snails. She is so emotional, that if she kills you during her fight, just before the game over screen appears, she can be seen covering her mouth in horror at what she has done.  </h3>
    <h1>Flowey the Flower</h1>
    <img src="FlowSprite.jpg">
    <h3 style="font-family:Futura"> At first, Flowey seems like your best friend. In fact, his theme is literally titled, "Your Best Friend" But Flowey is actually a remorseless, coldblooded killer. Flowey, as the name implies, is a small, dandelion (or golden flower). Flowey is hellbent on killing everybody in the entire underground, and wants to become godlike. The reason is unclear, but the fact that flowey is unable to show any signs of happiness, love or affection for anybody, is a possible contributer. Flowey is not actually what you think he is, and he hides a dark and sad secret and has a heart whrenching backstory. </h3>
    <h1>Asriel Dreemurr</h1>
    <img src="AsrSprite.jpg">
    <h3 style="font-family:Futura"> Asriel is the prince of th Underground. He is also Asgore's and Toriel's son. In appearance, Asriel is a young goat child, with a green and yellow striped shirt, like Frisk and Chara's. Asriel is kind hearted and outgoing, always happy to help. After Chara's apparent death, Asriel combined his soul with hers to become a godlike creature. He carried Chara's corpse to the human village to bury it. But the Humans thought Asriel had KILLED Chara, rather than the sickness. They attacked Asriel, mortally wounding him. Asriel died, but his conscience was transported to a golden flower, the very first to grow, thus creating Flowey.</h3>
    
    <h1> Asgore Dreemurr </h1>
    <img src="AsgSprite.jpg">
<h3 style="font-family:Futura"> Asgore is the king of the Underground. He is a gentle, kind old man who is very calm. So much so, the people of the Underground have come to call him "King Fluffybuns" Asgore was also the Trainer of Undyne, who ever since they were children, Undyne once tried to punch him, but missed. Asgore decided to help her, and trained her for many years. One day, she finally landed a blow on him. But Asgore got up, and was happy about it. Asgore is lovesick, as he has been alone ever since Toriel left her. If you save Toriel's Bscotch Pie, you can use it during his fight, which will remind him of something, weakening him. 
<h1> Sans </h1> 
    <img src="sanssprite.jpg">
<h3 style="font-family:Futura"> Sans is a couch potato, simply put. He likes to hang around and sometimes randomly dozes off. But Sans is a great guy, though. He is thoughtful and kind. He enjoys making jokes and puns, to his brother's frustration. Sans consistently breaks the 4th wall, from stopping time and teleportation. Sans is also aware that he is just a mere character in a video game. Sans fight is extremely hard, with relentless attacks and actually landing a blow on him is a pain. Sans' special attack is nothing at all. Why this is a good attack is because the game continuously waits for him to do something, but he doesn't. He also teases you for not being able to hit him.
<h1> Papyrus </h1>
    <img src="Papysprite.jpg">
<h3 style="font-family:Futura"> Papyrus is almost the polar opposite of his older brother, sans. He dislikes jokes and puns, and is very jumpy. Papyrus seems to have a craving for Spaghetti and stating "Nyeh heh HEH!!!" Papyrus has very high standards, which his brother uses to his advantage, making continuous puns and jokes to his extent. But Papyrus is not COMPLETELY different to Sans, as he is also generous and kind. Papyrus is like a 6 year old boy, as he is loud, friendly and playful. Papyrus hates to inflict pain onto people, as he demonstrates if he beats you in his fight, when he sends you to his garage instead of taking your life. Papyrus' cooking skills aren't great, but saying that to him will upset him deeply. His feelings are quite weak, as he can be easily upset and can cry. Papyrus states that he does everything to you just so he can gain friends and get some recognition.
<h1> Undyne </h1>
 <img src= "UndyneSprite.jpg">
<h3 style="font-family:Futura"> The local heroine of Waterfall, Undyne is an aggressive, strong and passionate woman. She likes to show off and is rather brash and hot headed. Undyne is also short tempered, so much so that during her fight, she might get so pissed of that she will probably hurl a large boulder, just, well...because. Undyne is missing her left ear, with an eye patch over it. She is, according to Papyrus, quite destructive, as most of her ideas have something to do with explosions. Gerson, the old scavenger shopkeeper in Waterfall is supposedly her mentor, who teaches her to be calm. Undyne, at first, appears to be an enemy, as she chases you around Waterfall, in attempt to capture you. Undyne seems to believe she can predict the future.
<h1> Doctor Alphys </h1>
    <img src= "AlphSprite.jpg">
<h3 style="font-family:Futura">  The royal scientist to Asgore, Alphys is weak, meek and sensitive. But she is also very intelligent. Alphys has a crush on Undyne, and tries to constantly show her that humans are cool... through anime. Alphys created Mettaton and accidentally created the Amalgamites in a past experiment. She watches Frisk along the journey through a enormous monitor, viewing their every move. Alphys is obsessed with Undyne, that she once screamed, "UNDYNE, HOLD MEEEEEEEE!!!!" Alphys supplied Papyrus with gadgets to help entice the human, but as the human started making friends, she started to like the human.
